Documentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project uses Doxygen markup in order to facilitate the generation of
documentation, which should be found when generated in the doc/ folder. Each
header in the include/ directory should also be well documented and can be used
as reference for programming.

In addition, some documentation is hosted in GitHub pages:
    https://gemarcano.github.io/libctr9/

In this folder there are explanations about the general design decisions taken.
